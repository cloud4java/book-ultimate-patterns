How can you integrate contract testing with a CI/CD pipeline?
To create a contract test between two projects in the current directory, you can use consumer-driven contract testing. This approach is particularly useful for microservices architectures, where different services need to communicate with each other. Here's how you can set up contract tests between your two projects: [1]

Choose a Contract Testing Framework: A popular choice for Java projects is Spring Cloud Contract. It integrates well with Spring Boot applications and supports both consumer and provider sides of the contract.

Set Up the Provider Project: In the provider project (let's assume it's the order-service), you'll define the contracts.a. Add the necessary dependencies to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

xml
b. Create a contract file in src/test/resources/contracts/. For example, shouldReturnOrder.groovy:
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract<p></p>

Copy

groovy
c. Create a base test class for your contracts:
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public abstract class BaseContractTest {<p></p>
<pre><code>@Autowired
private OrderService orderService;

@MockBean
private OrderRepository orderRepository;

@Before
public void setup() {
    RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new OrderController(orderService));

    // Setup your mock data
    when(orderRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(new Order(1L, 100L, 2, 29.99)));
}
</code></pre>

java
Set Up the Consumer Project: In the consumer project, you'll use the generated stubs from the provider.a. Add the necessary dependencies to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Copy

Insert at cursor
xml
b. Create a test class that uses the stub:


Copy

Insert at cursor
java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(
ids = {"com.javapatterns.observability:order-service:+:stubs"},
stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL
)
public class OrderClientContractTest {

@Autowired
private OrderClient orderClient;

@Test
public void testGetOrder() {
Order order = orderClient.getOrder(1L);
assertThat(order.getId()).isEqualTo(1L);
assertThat(order.getProductId()).isEqualTo(100L);
assertThat(order.getQuantity()).isEqualTo(2);
assertThat(order.getTotalPrice()).isEqualTo(29.99);
}

}


4. Run the Tests:
- In the provider project, run `mvn clean install` to generate the stubs.
- In the consumer project, run `mvn test` to execute the contract tests using the generated stubs.

This setup ensures that the contract between your two projects is maintained. If either side makes changes that break the contract, the tests will fail, alerting you to potential integration issues early in the development process.

Remember to keep your contracts up-to-date as your APIs evolve. Also, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline that runs these contract tests automatically to catch any breaking changes early.
